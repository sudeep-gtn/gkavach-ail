SourceCode listens to Global and select only keywords that are relevants to AIL's purpose (CVE, Exploits, Vulnerability,...), then send matching file to a new queue.

SourceCode.py search for differents languages such as C, PHP, Python, BASH and some Unix shells with default configuration.

Every records is send to the warning log because filters are high enough (hence the critical var set to 0 but can be changed).

FOR NOW : Still have troubles detecting ASM
